## Trist?
Trist is a library of methods for manipulating the 'trist' objects that are used in trystal.net and various other public and private applications.

## Um... trist?
A trist is a combination list/tree. It can be thought of as a list with some of the nesting capabilities you would find in a tree, hence: tree + list => trist.

## Ok... but why?
Trees are awesome for organizing vast collections of data (think of your filesystem on your computer) 
but are a little too rigid and clumsy to be used as interactive tools for organizing those items. 
By relaxing the tree struture just a bit, trists bring the awesome organizational power of trees 
into various mainstream editing tools, such as trystal.net.
