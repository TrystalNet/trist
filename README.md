## Trist?
Trist is a library of methods for manipulating 'trist' objects that are used in trystal.net and vairous other public and private applications.

## Um... trist?
A trist is a combination list/tree. It can be thought of as a list with some of the nesting capabilities you would find in a tree, hence: tree + list => trist.

## Ok... but why...
Trees are awesome for organizing vast collections but are a little too rigid and clumsy to be used as interactive tools for organizing those items. 
By relaxing the tree struture just a bit, trist brings the awesome organization power of trees into various mainstream editing tools, such as trystal.net.
